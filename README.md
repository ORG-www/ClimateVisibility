# ClimateVisibility

#A regression model to predict the visibility distance based on the given different climatic indicators in the training data. 

#Data Description
Data Description: This dataset predicts the visibility distance based on the different indicators as below:

⦁	VISIBILITY - Distance from which an object can be seen.
⦁	DRYBULBTEMPF-Dry bulb temperature (degrees Fahrenheit). Most commonly reported standard temperature.
⦁	WETBULBTEMPF-Wet bulb temperature (degrees Fahrenheit).
⦁	DewPointTempF-Dew point temperature (degrees Fahrenheit).
⦁	RelativeHumidity-Relative humidity (percent).
⦁	WindSpeed-Wind speed (miles per hour).
⦁	WindDirection-Wind direction from true north using compass directions.
⦁	StationPressure-Atmospheric pressure (inches of Mercury; or ‘in Hg’).
⦁	SeaLevelPressure- Sea level pressure (in Hg).
⦁	Precip	Total-precipitation in the past hour (in inches).
